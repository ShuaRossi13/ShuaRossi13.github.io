        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;As the semester began, I was already picking up interest in Buddhism. As such, I was fairly certain which group I would choose for my ethnography signature assignment. I was fortunate enough to know someone part of the Salt Lake Buddhist Temple. After making contact with Troy, who had introduced me to Buddhism, the main challenge was traversing the area that the temple was located in. With the abundance of traffic and construction paired with a lack of confidence in my own driving skill, anytime I wanted to do fieldwork at the temple, I had to fit it around not only my own schedule, but the schedule of whomever had to drive me to the temple, as well. In the beginning, this made conducting fieldwork relatively restrictive, but as time went on, I was able to contact members of the temple, get times and dates for certain events, and plan accordingly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;As the semester went by, the main challenge turned from traversal to informational. It took some deep thinking to search for questions that I felt needed to be answered. Much of the time spent in the field was spent listening to other members speak about their experiences and other newcomers ask questions. I finally began thinking of questions I wanted answered around halfway through the semester. I often asked Troy these questions given his amount of time at the temple. If he did not know, he would often direct me towards those who could answer whatever questions I was asking.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;By the time the semester was drawing to a close, I feared I did not know enough about the Buddhist community in Salt Lake City. After ruminating on this thought for some time, I feel as though I know a lot more than I initially realized. Much of my knowledge was absorbed passively rather than actively, which has seemingly given me a view that has a larger scope of understanding than if I had actively focused on what I knew that I did not know. It opened me to facets of Buddhism that would never have occurred to me otherwise.</p>

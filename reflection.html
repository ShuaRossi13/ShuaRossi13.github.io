        <p class="paragraph">As the semester began, I was already picking up interest in Buddhism. As such, I was fairly certain which group I would choose for my ethnography signature assignment. I was fortunate enough to know someone part of the Salt Lake Buddhist Temple. After making contact with Troy, who had introduced me to Buddhism, the main challenge was traversing the area that the temple was located in. With the abundance of traffic and construction paired with a lack of confidence in my own driving skill, anytime I wanted to do fieldwork at the temple, I had to fit it around not only my own schedule, but the schedule of whomever had to drive me to the temple, as well. In the beginning, this made conducting fieldwork relatively restrictive, but as time went on, I was able to contact members of the temple, get times and dates for certain events, and plan accordingly.</p>

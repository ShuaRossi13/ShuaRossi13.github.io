        <p class="paragraph-title">Preparation for the field</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;Preparation for my fieldwork began well before I began my studies in college. When I was in the boy scout troop 410, a scout leader named Troy had joined the troop while he was part of the Buddhist temple in Salt Lake City. After getting to know my father and I, he offered to introduce us to the Buddhist temple. At the time, we did not have the time or coordination to join the temple. Several years later, in 2024, I had begun doing some minor research into Buddhist teachings online, slowly learning small bits and pieces. After putting some time into this research, I spoke with my father about wanting to learn more about Buddhism as a concept, to which he reminded me that someone had offered to introduce us. We reached out to Troy to see if this offer was still on the table. He obliged and gave us information on the times, dates, and location that the temple would be open.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-title">Fieldwork during first arrival</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;On January 20th, 2024, at 10:00 AM., my mother, father, and I drove up to the temple for the first time. We were asked to come to the front of the pews in order to be guided in the traditions preceding the ceremony and ask questions after the ceremony. We were guided through how to use incense in which you step forward with your right foot first, then your left foot, grab a pinch of incense from the bowl next to the burner, put the incense into the burner, step away from the burner with your left foot first, then your right, bow, speak the phrase “namu abida butsu” (spoken in one breath), then return to your pew. As the ceremony began, the audience was introduced to the week’s member that will lead the temple in a Sutra Chant in which the members of the church would chant together in a semi-musical pattern with the phonetic spelling of the chant displayed on screens at the front of the hall. The priest then gave a Dharma talk about being mindful when eating, something that gave me pause and made me think. The talk didn’t feel like a condemnation of those who do not heed its advice, it felt like a prompt for the audience to think. The ceremony then ended with a short chant and a series of announcements pertaining to members of the temple. Afterward, a woman named Dot asked us if we have any questions. My mother asked about the beads on many members’ wrists. Dot replied that they were thought-beads, made to represent the right thoughts in Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism (also known as Shin Buddhism). I asked how the temple accommodated for those who are hard of hearing. The response was that no accommodation was in place but they would be sure to learn or create accommodations should they be necessary. My mother requested to visit the west wing of the temple which includes a gift shop, a garden, and a meditation room. Dot obliged and took the group of newcomers to the temple to the west wing. She guided a tour through the building, displaying the garden and the gift shop. I found a set of thought-beads that I liked, and Dot offered them for free, despite my willingness to pay the listed price for them. While in the gift shop, I spoke with some of the other members who had recently joined. Most specified a curiosity about Buddhism, one person spoke about how it is the most queer accepting religion they could find. After that, we said goodbye to the other members and returned home for the day.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-title">Continued fieldwork</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;I returned to the temple a few more times to ask questions and listen to the Dharma talks. The Dharma talks gave me information on shared beliefs in Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism and a history of the temple. One of the shared beliefs is that animals feel an emotional breadth similar to us yet can hold many values that are not often found in human societies, stating that we should attempt to emulate our pets and the values they represent. Another is that all people, regardless of creed, are worthy and welcomed into enlightenment should they find a way to get to it. Many members wear thought-beads, but their beliefs and reasoning surrounding the wearing of these beads is rather varied. Some purport that the beads are a reminder to think kind thoughts, others feel they provide a connection to the Buddha, and many simply make a claim to authority by stating that it seems to be a social expectation amongst the temple members. I also returned to the temple to join a meditation practice, which I learned was not a common practice amongst Shin Buddhists.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-title">History of the Temple</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;According to Troy, the temple was founded around 1911-1912 when some of the first Japanese American immigrants began moving to Salt Lake City for work. As many Japanese immigrants moved to the U.S., they wanted to bring some of their cultural and religious customs with them to be continued in the United States. To do so, they communicated with their Temple Headquarters in Kyoto, Japan, asking if the headquarters could send a Buddhist Priest to the U.S. In 1899, the Temple Headquarters set up a U.S. headquarters branch in San Francisco, California which presided over the West Coast of the U.S. This branch opted to build several temples, one of which was in Salt Lake City. The temple received its first priest in 1912 and held its first service that same year. The temple remained almost exclusively of Japanese membership for many years following its founding. Due to this, membership and services became very sparse during World War II due to the relocation of many Japanese Americans by the U.S. government to internment camps. Rev. Jerry K. Hirano purported that this created a further divide and encouraged a yet further exclusivist Japanese view in the temple, going so far as to turn away those who were not Japanese until the early 70s when the reverend at the time, Hakubun Watanabe, felt that such a view was antithetical to the beliefs set forward by Buddhism. This also opened the temple to alternative forms of Buddhism that did not share the same practices as Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism. Pews were added to the temple hall to seem more familiar to those coming from Western religions. One of the meditation guides informed me that meditation practices began being scheduled every Wednesday in 2014.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-title">Interview</p>
        <P class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;On March 31st, 2024, I interviewed Troy. I wanted to understand how he viewed and comprehended Buddhist practices throughout life. When asked how he was introduced to Buddhism, Troy explained that he was born into it. He remarks that, for the majority of his childhood, he didn’t feel much of a connection to Buddhism. He learned much of it, but he didn’t feel as though he belonged to the beliefs in it. This continued until he joined the military in his early 20s. There, he did as much as he could to help those around him and began to feel a legitimate belief in the teachings of Buddhism. He began to buy books teaching tenets and the history of the religion. After some time, he decided he decided to teach Buddhism and began taking classes to gain certifications that allowed him to teach and even become a Buddhist priest. He now teaches Buddhism at the temple every Sunday.</P>
        <P class="paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;After he finished recounting his life story with Buddhism, I asked him if there were any specific teachings or practices that he personally valued. He began speaking on the main tenets of Buddhism called the Eightfold Path, which is meant to quell suffering. He said he values this as he saw suffering while he was in the military and feels that following the Eightfold Path could have mitigated the suffering he saw. I asked if there we any other teachings or practices that he felt a special connection to. He then spoke about the shrine he has at home, typically called a butsudan, that he refers to as an Obutsudan. He places photographs of deceased relatives on the shrine and meditates next to it. He says he feels this helps him practice gratitude for the deceased and allows him to center himself before he sleeps. I asked him what literature inspired him in Buddhism. He recommended Heart of the Buddha by Thich Nhat Hanh and says that he feels that Thich Nhat Hanh is an excellent source on Buddhism.</P>
